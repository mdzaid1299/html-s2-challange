                During our initial discussions on our gaming site designs, we were a bit apprehensive. But as the work progressed, the hurdles were overcome and the connects with Nancy Davilio became very delightful. The much appreciable quality about her is that she is very positive at receiving feedback (good or not so good) on her work. And this resulted in an overall an awesome product as we had expected.
